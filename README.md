# pysui

Python Client SDK for Sui blockchain

**NOTICE: README FIRST**
SUI 0.21.0 introduces a change to keystore (file) keystring persist.

If you still have keystores from pre 0.21.0, run the utility [keys-to-0210](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/blob/main/samples/README.md)

This utility SHOULD BE RUN BEFORE USING `pysui` SDK or samples

If you have already regenerated keys with the SUI 0.21.0 binary install you can ignore the utility usage.

**Release-0.9.1**

- Breaking changes
- 100% coverage (builders, return types, etc.) and parity with _SUI 0.22.1 API_

**PyPi**

- [Latest PyPi Version](https://pypi.org/project/pysui/)

There is a companion package called [pysui-gadgets](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui_gadgets) with a few utilities and ge-gaws that
you may find interesting. It is a separate package also on on PyPi.
