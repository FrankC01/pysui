# pysui examples and utilities

Samples and utilities included in both the `pysui` repo as well as when installing through PyPi


## Examples:

### async-gas

Reports all Sui coins for `pysui` addresses.

### sgqls

Writes one or more GraphQL node's schema to folder

### wallet

Implementation demonstrating most commands like the SUI CLI (i.e. `sui client ...`) using Sui GraphQL RPC.

### smash

Merges an addresses Sui coins to one

### splay

Spreads an address coins to itself or one to many other addresses

### jtobcs

Converts a JSON document with BCS specification to a python BCS module (*.py)

### bcstoj

Converts a python BCS module to a JSON document (*.json)

### mtobcs

Generate python BCS constructs from published move struct or enum

This requires a json file identifying _one or more_ structures/enums to process. For example, using devnet, this json identifies the a example contract strucutre (assume file name is `parm_object.json`):

```json
{
    "targets" : [
        {
            "type": "Structure",
            "value":"0x379096e390310dd7690802fe356ffcf2d7eb7adef458762cd761352b090a1cb1::parms::ParmObject",
            "out_file": "parm_object.py"
        }
    ]
}
```

`mtobcs --profile devnet -m parm_object.json`

This will generate a `parm_object.py` file containing the BCS equivalent.

**Note:** If running from cloned repo, examples are started with `python -m ....`

- `python -m samples.async_gasg`
- `python -m samples.sgqls`
- `python -m samples.smash`
- `python -m samples.splay`
- `python -m samples.walletg`
- `python -m samples.jtobcs`
- `python -m samples.bcstoj`
- `python -m samples.mtobcs`

**Note:** If running from PyPi install, or installed into virtual env with `pip install -e...`, examples can be started directly

- `async-gas`
- `sgqls`
- `smash`
- `splay`
- `wallet`
- `jtobcs`
- `bcstoj`
- `mtobcs`
