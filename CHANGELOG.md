## [0.33.0] - 2023-08-11

**BREAKING CHANGE**

With this release, the `bip-utils` library has been removed in favor of `pysui-fastcrypto`. This is a
Python wrapper around the MystenLabs `fastcrypto` Rust crate.

Because of this change, installing pysui now requires Rust and Cargo to be installed,
see [Rust Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will allow the Rust crate and wrapper to be
built specific to your platform.

### Added

- [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/116) SuiTransaction serialize/deseralize
- [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/143) Ability to add a new key to the
  SuiConfig. The argument can either be a Sui keystring _or_ a dict for importing keys exported from Wallet. The
  dict must take the form of:

  ```python
    {
      'wallet_key':'0x.....',             # Wallet exported key hex string (66 chars with 0x prefix)
      'key_scheme': SignatureScheme.XYZ   # Where XYZ is one of {ED25519, SECP256k1, SECP256r1}
    }

  ```

- The concert with the above enhancement, if initiating `pysui` with `SuiConfig.user_config(...)` the `prv_keys`
  parameter can be a list of Sui keystrings, the dict as described above, or both.

### Fixed

- [bug](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/148) Attempt to write to non-existant keystore

### Changed

- [change]((<https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/144>) `pysui` now requires pysui-fastcrypto

  but generic SuiKeyPair, SuiPublicKey and SuiPrivateKey classes
- [change](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/147) Allowing transaction command Result in split_coin amounts list
- `create_new_keypair_and_address` on SuiConfig now takes word_counts (int) instead of mnemonic phrase
- Simplified MultiSig BCS construct
- Documentation

### Removed

## [0.32.0] - 2023-08-03

**BREAKING CHANGE**

### Added

- OP_STRATEGIES.md explaining deprecation, release and publishing strategies

### Fixed

- [**BREAKING bug**](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/146) See 'Changed' below this line...

### Changed

- The SuiTransaction execute method's `gas_budget` argument now strictly sets the gas budget for the transaction. Prior, an inspection
would be run and pysui used the greater of the two. Now, `gas_budget`'s default is an emptry string ("") and by leaving it that
way a dryRun will be run prior to execution to set the budget.

- **Breaking Change** Assertion on SuiTransaction that will fail operations on it if it's been executed already
- Implemented NameServiceAddress and NameServiceNames builders and results for supporing `suix_resolveNameServiceAddress` and `suix_resolveNameServiceNames` respectivly.
- `merge_gas_budget` to SuiTransaction constructor. When attempting to find available gas coin for transaction, this flag if true,
  allows a merge of coins to meet budget demand. Defaults to False

### Fixed

- Field declaration in Effects result.
- Bug in SuiTransaction builder argument resolution method.

### Changed

- Extended CompiledPackage to hold blake2b digest to match chain digest calculation. Used in package upgrades in SuiTransaction.
- Introspection on SuiTransaction `move_call` target function to better return reusuable command results
- **Breaking Change** SuiTransaction constructor and execute methods simplified while making signing more powerful
- **Breaking Change** SuiTransaction `split_coin` now takes list of amounts and returns list of results.
- **Breaking Change** SuiTransaction `move_call` now takes target string in form: `"package_id::module_name::function_name"`
- **Breaking Change** `build_for_execute` method made private on SuiTransaction

### Removed

- **Breaking Change** `gasses` property from SuiTransaction

## [0.16.1] 2023-04-16

We've started to 'deprecate' various functions, classes and methods to provide early warnings where
your usage of `pysui` should consider changing.

### Added

- `split_coin_equal` to SuiTransaction (a.k.a. Transaction Builder)
- Support for signing with MultiSig in SuiTransaction
- Support for running locally using [sui-base](https://github.com/sui-base/sui-base). The advantages are
  the availabbility of highly configurable local nodes, management of different versions of Sui and consistent
  wallet addresses across configuration.
- New pytests leveraging `sui-base`

### Fixed

### Changed

- Changed methods for loading a configuration. Choices are now:
  1. `SuiClient.default_config()` (default configuration loading)
  2. `SuiClient.sui_base_config()` (if running sui-base locally)

### Removed

## [0.16.0] 2023-04-13

### Added

- MultiSig added [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/75)
- Implemented pysui.sui.sui_clients.Transaction/Transaction builder supporting Programmable Transactions [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/83)
- Documentation for Programmable Transaction in read-the-docs

### Fixed

- GetTotalTxCount underlying RPC API method [fixed](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/82)
- GetMultipleTx was calling obsolete RPC API method.
- Result type from calling faucet
- Added default dependency IDs for 0x1 and 0x2 in sui_utils.py for publishing

### Changed

- _**Most, if not all, integer values as arguments to RPC methods have been changes in Sui 0.31.0 to strings
  to support bigger integers for platforms without arbitrarily large numbers (ALN). This has resulted in
  changes to many `pysui` Builder and result types.**_
- Gas requirements for transactions have increased 1000x on devnet. Use `GetReferenceGasPrice` and `DryRunTransaction` often until you get used to the [changes](https://docs.sui.io/devnet/build/sui-gas-charges).
- Increased default RPC timeout from 30 to 120 seconds on synch and asynch SuiClients.

### Removed

- GetTxs aligning to dropped methods in RPC API 0.29.1
- GetTransactionsInRange aligning to dropped methods in RPC API 0.29.1

- **Breaking Change** Prior 'module build' functions in `sui_utils.py` to support publishing have been replaced with `publish_build`. At the moment this will only prepare the core package modules. We will follow up with publishing unpublished dependencies in a later release. If you need that capabilit, use `sui client publish ...` from command line.

  - new_txn_subscription removed from `sui_client.subscribe`
  - SubscribeTransaction removed from sui_builders and respective results from sui_txresults

## [0.13.0] 2023-02-16

BREAKING Changes

### Added

- **Experimental** `sui_bcs.py` - work in progress to enable `sui_devInspectTransaction`

  - Sui 0.25.0 only supports inspection on:

    - sui_transferObject
    - sui_transferSui
    - sui_pay
    - sui_moveCall
    - sui_batchTransaction

  - There are a few ways to get the BCS serialized TransactionKind argument for InspectTransaction builder

    - `sui_bcs.bcs_txkind_from_result` - Takes result from a `client.execute_no_sign`. However; because calling
      SUI RPC requires providing a `gas` object and `gas_budget` value that may not be feasible for your use case.

      ```python
      try:
          batch_params = SuiArray(
              [
                  TransferObjectParams(

                  ),
                  MoveCallRequestParams(
                      package_object=ObjectID("0x2"),
                      module_str=SuiString("pay"),
                      function_str=SuiString("join"),
                      type_arguments=SuiArray([SuiString("0x2::sui::SUI")]),
                      arguments=SuiArray(
                          [
                              SuiString("0x0b5b6f3f2e407d1a3f6c82d716ede72b394b7ca9"),
                              SuiString("0x30082e169ba9f2c92b1be1763870ea9a9a7b6180"),
                          ]
                      ),

          builder = BatchTransaction(
              cfg.active_address,
              batch_params,
              ObjectID("0x0b5b6f3f2e407d1a3f6c82d716ede72b394b7ca9"),
              SuiInteger(2000),
          )

          # Call execution but do not sign and submit
          rpc_result = client.execute_no_sign(builder)

          iresult = sync_client.execute(
              InspectTransaction(
                  sender_address=cfg.active_address,
                  tx_bytes=bcs_txkind_from_result(rpc_result),
              )
          )
          if iresult.is_ok():
            print(iresult.result_data.to_json(indent=2))
          else:
            print(iresult.result_string)
      # And so on...
      except ..:

      ```

    - `sui_bcs.bcs_base64_from_builder` - Takes a Builder and returns BCS encoded base64 string. Here the
      `gas` object and `gas_budget` use a stock substitue value (FAKE_ADDRESS_OR_OBJECT) that are ignored.

      ```python
      transfer_params = SuiArray(
          [
              MoveCallRequestParams(
                  package_object=ObjectID("0x2"),
                  module_str=SuiString("pay"),
                  function_str=SuiString("join"),
                  type_arguments=SuiArray([SuiString("0x2::sui::SUI")]),
                  arguments=SuiArray(
                      [
                          SuiString("0x0b5b6f3f2e407d1a3f6c82d716ede72b394b7ca9"),
                          SuiString("0x30082e169ba9f2c92b1be1763870ea9a9a7b6180"),

              ),
          ]
      )
      bt_builder = BatchTransaction(
          SuiAddress(FAKE_ADDRESS_OR_OBJECT), transfer_params, ObjectID(FAKE_ADDRESS_OR_OBJECT), SuiInteger(1)
      )
      bcs_bt = bcs_from_builder(sync_client, bt_builder)

      iresult = sync_client.execute(
          InspectTransaction(
            sender_address=sync_client.config.active_address,
            tx_bytes=base64.b64encode(bcs_bt.serialize()).decode())
      )
      if iresult.is_ok():
          print(iresult.result_data.to_json(indent=2))
      else:
          print(iresult.result_string)
      ```

    - We are working on the 3rd option (low level) where you can directly code the BCS constructs and
      serialize directly into the InspectTransaction `tx_bytes` field.

### Removed

## [0.5.0] - 2022-12-19

### Added

- Support for `sui_getBalance` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns
  total balance per coin type (i.e. `0x2::sui::SUI`) for owner (SuiAddress) and is more efficient than getting all coins and
  totalling.
- Support for `sui_getCoins` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns
  address coins for coin type (i.e. `0x2::sui::SUI`) and is more efficient than getting all coin descriptors and
  sui_getObject for each descriptor.
- Support for `sui_getTotalSupply` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns the
  total supply of coin_type (i.e. `0x2::sui::SUI`).

  SUI system state information.
- Support for `sui_getTransactionsInRange` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns a list of transaction digests strings within the queried transaction sequence range: `start` (inclusive) and `end` (exclusive).
