### Removed

## [0.5.0] - 2022-12-19

### Added

- Support for `sui_getBalance` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns

  totalling.

  address coins for coin type (i.e. `0x2::sui::SUI`) and is more efficient than getting all coin descriptors and
  sui_getObject for each descriptor.
- Support for `sui_getTotalSupply` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns the
  total supply of coin_type (i.e. `0x2::sui::SUI`).

  SUI system state information.
- Support for `sui_getTransactionsInRange` [enhancement](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues/46). This returns a list of transaction digests strings within the queried transaction sequence range: `start` (inclusive) and `end` (exclusive).
