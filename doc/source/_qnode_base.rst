General
-------

With ``pysui's GraphQL`` implementation a number of pre-built and ready to use
 QueryNodes were delivered as part of the pysui package.

The pre-built module :py:mod:`pysui.sui.sui_pgql.pgql_query` contains
QueryNodes for a number of query and execution classes requiring only simple
parameters.
