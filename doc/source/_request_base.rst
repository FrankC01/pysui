General
-------

With ``pysui's gRPC`` implementation a number of pre-built and ready to use
requests are delivered as part of the pysui package.

The pre-builts module :py:mod:`pysui.sui.sui_grpc.pgrpc_requests` contains
requests for a number of query and execution classes requiring only simple
parameters.
